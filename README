BosCommuteBot is a Telegram Bot that wants to help make your commute at least 0.5% more pleasant.

Inquiring about the weather and the status of the T will allow you to reevalute your apartment departure strategy in the morning

**To Run:**
	1. Install Telegram, the secure messaging app
	2. Search for @BosCommuteBot
	3. Ask the Bot for advice: 
		'go' returns a short weather report and T status
